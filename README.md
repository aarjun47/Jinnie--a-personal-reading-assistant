Jinnie is a Chrome plugin designed not just to summarize articles, but to let you interact with them intelligently.
Instead of copying links from blogs or articles and pasting them into GPT tools, you can simply click on the Jinnie plugin while reading. 
It scrapes the entire article in the background and opens a sleek assistant overlay where you can ask any question. 
Jinnie will respond conversationally, using only the information from that article—like chatting with a friend who just finished reading it.
On the backend, the plugin leverages the deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528-qwen3-8b:free model through OpenRouter.
The scraped content and your query are passed as a prompt to the model, ensuring that answers are context-aware and grounded solely in the article’s content.
